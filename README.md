## Todo List JSON Format

The todo data is stored in a JSON file called `data.json`. The JSON format is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Todo 1",
    "completed": false
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Todo 2",
    "completed": true
  }
]
```

Note: This is just a basic example of the JSON format. You can add or remove fields as needed to suit your requirements.
